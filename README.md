This web app is a social media blog that allows users to register and login to a blog where users can fill out 
a form and add there favorite book with information about each book like a title, description, genre, author, ratings and review. 

I also implemented Geminis API to let the users ask it for a recommendation based off of their previous added books. This way the user doesn't have to
think hard about what next book to read. 

My prime focus was to learn about A.I using a free tier service like Gemini since Open AI you needed to pay for.
